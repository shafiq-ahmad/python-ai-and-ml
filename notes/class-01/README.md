## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The work that was done earlier by humans is now being done by machines
It refers to computer systems or machiness that are capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Based on data

### Key characteristics

Learning AI systems can learn from data and improve their capablities over time without being explicitly programmed Machine learning and deep learning subsets of AI.

Data is training the model and also correcting

### Resasoning

Resasoning AI can use logic and inference rules to solve he problems.
Systems can complete tasks by analyzing available data and then taking the most appropriate action.

### Self correction

AI systems can monitor their own performance, learn from experience and adjust behaviours to imprvoe over time.

### Adaptability

AI can adapt to new inputs and scenarios that were not part of its initial training. This allows systems to handle real-world variable and complixity.

### Natural language processing

Understanding and generating human language, including speeh recognition, translation and dialog systems.

### Computer Vision (CV)

Processing and analyzing visual inputs like images and videos using pattern recognition. Enable applications like facial recognition

### Robotics

AI is being to develop autonomous robots and vehicles that can perform tasks without human oversight.

### AI

While narrow AI can outperform humans in specialized tasks, general AI with with capabilities rivaling human intelligence cross all domains has not yet been achieved. But AI research and applications continue to evolve rapidly.

#### Narrow AI

Focused on singled defined tasks outperform humans in specialized domain.
Based on current AI capablities examples are chess machines, self-driving cars

#### General AI

Has general intelligence and capabilites can reson, plan communicate across domain.
Adapts to new environments and
