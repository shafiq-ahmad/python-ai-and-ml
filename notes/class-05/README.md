Data life cycle in data science
Acquire / ask
    Clean / process
        Use / reuse / analyze
            publish / report
                destroy / preerve / save

Acquire for data  
    if tabulated: called structured data
    audio / images: unstructure

Before collection data 
we need wh question to asked
    why, how, where, who, when


Role of Data scientist
    Understand business
    Data aquisition / understanding
    Data preprare
    Data modeling (ml/dl)
    Data / model evaluate
    Deployment
    Monitor
    Optimization
    Tools: PowerBI / Tabelue / Python

Role Data Analist
    Required info about data (meta data)
    Data collection
    Assigned goals by company
    Data cleaning
    EDA (Exploratory data analysis)
    Inference generations
    model
    Deployment
    Intrepret
    visualization
    Report writng
    Tools: PowerBI or Tabelue

Scale of measurement of data
    Nominal: single question where you require one answer line what is your name:
    Ordinal: 1st, second, third or order
    Interval: named + ordered + proportions Interval
        distance, or difference
    Ratio: money, etc (where zero is posibe)

Data 
    Qualitative data: categorical data
        Nominal and Ordinal
    Quantitative data: numric data
        Discreat data (int)
        Continues data (float)
            Inerval and ratio
    
Types of data analatics
    descriptive
        what happened in data?
        what data saying
        ex: 70k subscriber got last year
            by exploring data
    diagnoslics
        Why did it happened?
        ex: free course offered
            by performing EDA
    predictive
        what will happened?
        ex: next year 70k - 90k new
            by ML / DL
    prescriptive
        how can we make it happened
            ex:
                by data making decision


Life cycle of data scientist
    Aquire the data
        create, capture, gather, etc
    Clean
        Organizing, filter, anotate, clean
    Use
        Analyze, mining, model, derive desiction, data viz, decide, act, drive ...

    Publish
        Share, workflow, portal, literature, store the data
        publish a tool as ML/DL on the web
    Store data
