# Features

## Label encoding

Simply convert categorical data into numerical

One-hot encoding: one hot (1) in one column

Ordinal encoding: your choice's order

Binary encoding. same as one-hot but only 0-1. merge two columns

Frequency count encoding

## Why encoding

- Most algorithm are prone to numeric values
- Effeciency and performance
- Feature representations
- Support unseen categories
- Reducing memory usage (resources)

## Data Discretization

definition of data discretization:
is a preprocessing technique used to transform continues or numericial data into discrete catefories or bins.
some algorithms handle categorical data instead of numbers. transform number columns into bins and categories
